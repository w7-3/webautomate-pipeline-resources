# WebAutomate Project-StepList Specification

In the specification for the WebAutomate project configuration file, the `solution.config.stepList.[]` is a list of steps that are executed in the order they are defined. The steps can be of different types, such as actions, conditions, loops, and solutions.

In a WebAutomate Project Specification, the stepList is found at - `solution.config.stepList`: `Array<object>`. All steps have the following properties:

## `solution.config.stepList.[].id`: `string`
An arbitrary id

## `solution.config.stepList.[].stepType`: `string`
The specification of an item depends on the stepType. The following options are available:

- `solution`: `string` - The solution step, which depends on the `solution.appName`
- `action`: `string` - The action step, which depends on the type of browser action that should be carried out
- `condition`: `string` - The condition step, which depends on the type of condition that should be checked
- `loop`: `string` - The loop step, which depends on the type of loop that should be executed

## `solution.config.stepList.[].type`: `string`
The type of the step, which depends on the `solution.config.stepList.[].stepType` (More details below).

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].categoryId`: `string`
The category id of the step, which depends on the stepType.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].label`: `string`
The label of the step, which is displayed in the WebAutomate UI. This is a human-readable label, which should be used to identify the step.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].labelStrategy`: `string`
The strategy to be used to generate the label. The options are:
- `LABEL`: `string` - The label is generated from the label property
- `JS`: `string` - The label is generated from the labelScript property

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].fallbackLabel`: `string`
if the label is generated from the labelScript property, this is the fallback label to be used, if the labelScript is not valid or no valid value is returned

#### `solution.config.stepList.[].labelScript` â€“ `object`
This object contains the JavaScript code to be executed to generate the label. The function is executed in the context of the page and can therefore access the DOM and the JavaScript context of the page. The function should return a string, which is used as the label.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].labelScript.value`: `string`
The JavaScript code to be executed to generate the label
- (e.g., `return document.querySelector('.target-element').innerText;`)

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].selector`: `string`
If the step is targeted to a specific element, this is the selector to be used to identify the element. The selector is used to identify the element in the DOM and can therefore be used to target specific elements on the page.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].abortOnError`: `boolean`
When this is set to true, the step will be aborted, if an error occurs. This is useful to stop the execution of the solution, if an error occurs.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].ignoreOnError`: `boolean`
If this step is executed within a loop, this indicates if the step should be ignored, if an error occurs. This is useful to continue the execution of the loop, even if an error occurs.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].originalStepIndex`: `number`
This is the original index of the step in the solution. This is used to identify the step in the WebAutomate UI and is used to identify the step in the WebAutomate system, so the evaluation of the step can be tracked irrespective of the order of the steps in the solution.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].solution`: `string`
This is only used for the solution step (`solution.config.stepList.[].stepType` = `solution`) and is used to identify the solution in the WebAutomate system.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].*` Specific for `solution.appName` === `lightHouse`
As mentioned above, lightHouse projects do not have a step list, so this list will be empty. The lightHouse project will be executed as a single step and the configuration is done in the `solution.config` object.

##### `solution.config.stepList.[].*` Specific for `solution.appName` === `dataExtractions`
This is only used for the dataExtractions solution and is used to identify the data extractions in the WebAutomate system.

        - `solution.config.stepList.[].value.ai.confidenceLevel` < 50 implies low: The AI is very lenient and will accept a wide range of elements, which may lead to false positives (accepting elements that are not relevant).
        - 50 <= `solution.config.stepList.[].value.ai.confidenceLevel` < 90 implies medium: The AI will be more selective and will only accept elements that are very likely to be relevant, reducing the chance of false positives.
        - `solution.config.stepList.[].value.ai.confidenceLevel` > 90 implies high: The AI is very strict and will only accept elements that are very likely to be relevant, reducing the chance of false positives even further.
      - `solution.config.stepList.[].value.ai.reuseSelectors`: `boolean` - If this is set to true, the AI will reuse the selectors from the previous steps, if available. This can be useful to avoid re-identifying elements that have already been identified in previous steps. If this is set to false, the AI will always identify the elements from scratch.

    "selector": ".my-element",
    "abortOnError": false,
    "ignoreOnError": false,
    "originalStepIndex": 45
}
```

- `solution.config.stepList.[].selector` - The CSS selector of the element that should be hovered. The element is identified by the CSS selector, and the mouse pointer is moved to the center of the element. If the element is not found, the step fails.

##### If `solution.config.stepList.[].stepType` === `action` && `solution.config.stepList.[].categoryId` === `userInteractionEvents` && `solution.config.stepList.[].type` === `elementClick`

- `left`: `string` - The left mouse button is clicked. This is the default value.
- `middle`: `string` - The middle mouse button is clicked.
- `right`: `string` - The right mouse button is clicked.

If `solution.config.stepList.[].value.buttonType` === `left`, then the following properties are available in `solution.config.stepList.[].value`:

- `solution.config.stepList.[].value.clickCount`: `number` - The number of times the left mouse button is clicked. 

If `solution.config.stepList.[].value.buttonType` === `left`, then `solution.config.stepList.[].value.clickCount` is needed, which can be one of:
- `1`: `number` - The left mouse button is clicked once.
- `2`: `number` - The left mouse button is clicked twice.

If `solution.config.stepList.[].value.buttonType` === `left` and `solution.config.stepList.[].value.clickCount` === `1`, then the following properties are available:
  - `solution.config.stepList.[].value.delay`: `number` - The delay in milliseconds before the button is released after the click. This is useful for simulating a long press or a double click. The default value is `0`, which means that the button is released immediately after the click.

Example of a `solution.config.stepList.[].*` for `elementClick`, when the left button is clicked once:
```json

- `dialogHandling`: `string` - This action is used to configure the dialog handling settings of the AI browser. It is useful for configuring how the AI browser handles dialogs, such as alerts, prompts, and confirmations.

##### If `solution.config.stepList.[].stepType` === `action` && `solution.config.stepList.[].categoryId` === `settings` and `solution.config.stepList.[].type` === `dialogHandling`
This action is used to configure the dialog handling settings of the AI browser. It is useful for configuring how the AI browser handles dialogs, such as alerts, prompts, and confirmations. The `solution.config.stepList.[].value` is an object with the following properties:

- `solution.config.stepList.[].value.decision`: `accept | reject` - The decision to be made when a dialog is encountered. The options are:
  - `accept`: `string` - The dialog is accepted.
  - `reject`: `string` - The dialog is rejected.
- `solution.config.stepList.[].value.promptText`: `string` - The text to be displayed in the dialog prompt. This is used when the dialog is a prompt dialog and the AI browser needs to provide a response.

Example of a `solution.config.stepList.[].*` for `dialogHandling` that should be accepted:
